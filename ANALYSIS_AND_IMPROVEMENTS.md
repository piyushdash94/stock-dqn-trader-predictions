# Repository Analysis

This repository provides a single Jupyter notebook implementing a stock price prediction and DQN-based trading agent. The notebook fetches data from Yahoo Finance, engineers technical indicators, and trains a reinforcement learning agent to trade on Infosys (INFY.NS) data.

## Current Structure
- `DQN_Trading_NSE_predictions.ipynb` – main notebook with all code.
- `README.md` – overview of the project and how to run the notebook.
- `README_Stock_Prediction_DQN_Trading.md` – extended documentation with a section on suggested enhancements.
- `requirements.txt` – lists Python packages used, but without version pinning.
- `gitignore` – excludes common artifacts from version control.

## Suggested Improvements
1. **Refactor the Notebook**
   - Convert repeated code blocks into standalone Python modules or scripts. This makes the project easier to test and reuse.
2. **Add Version-Pinned Requirements**
   - Specify package versions in `requirements.txt` to ensure reproducible environments.
3. **Provide a License File**
   - Include a `LICENSE` document so others know how they can use or modify this code.
4. **Expand Testing and CI**
   - Add automated tests (even simple ones) and optionally a CI workflow so changes can be validated automatically.
5. **Improve Documentation**
   - Merge the two README files or cross-link them so users have a single entry point.
   - Explain how to adapt the environment to other stocks.
6. **Risk Disclaimer**
   - Consider adding a disclaimer about financial risk and that this project is for research or educational purposes.

The extended README already lists a few potential enhancements, such as exploring Double DQN or other indicators:

```
- Compare with **Double DQN**, **Dueling DQN**, or **PPO**
- Try more indicators like **MACD**, **Bollinger Bands**
- Add **risk management rules** like stop-loss
- Extend the setup to **multiple assets or ETFs**
```

These points (found around line 104 in `README_Stock_Prediction_DQN_Trading.md`) are a good starting place for future work.
